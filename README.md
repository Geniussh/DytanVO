# DytanVO: Joint Refinement of Visual Odometry and Motion Segmentation in Dynamic Environments

This repository will be used to release our code for the most recent ICRA 2023 submission, [_DytanVO: Joint Refinement of Visual Odometry and Motion Segmentation in Dynamic Environments_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08430). DytanVO is the first supervised learning-based VO method that handles dynamic environments.
