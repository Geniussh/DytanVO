# DytanVO: Joint Refinement of Visual Odometry and Motion Segmentation in Dynamic Environments

This repository will be used to release our code for the most recent ICRA 2023 submission, _DytanVO: Joint Refinement of Visual Odometry and Motion Segmentation in Dynamic Environments_. DytanVO is the first supervised learning-based VO method that handles dynamic environments.
